# BFSK_QPSK_Modulation_Demodulation
user can Modulate and Demodulate a signal. using bit time, No of bits to transfer, roll-off factor etc. user can see the processes of Modulation and Demodulation 

Step1:Open from.mlapp
![Test Image 1](https://github.com/mrchocha/BFSK_QPSK_Modulation_Demodulation/blob/master/snaps/pasted%20image%200.png)

step2:Click start

step3:Select QPSK or BFSK  
![Test Image 2](https://github.com/mrchocha/BFSK_QPSK_Modulation_Demodulation/blob/master/snaps/pasted%20image%200%20(1).png)

step4:QPSK(Enter necessary parameters)
![Test Image 3](https://github.com/mrchocha/BFSK_QPSK_Modulation_Demodulation/blob/master/snaps/pasted%20image%200%20(2).png)
Here, bits will rendomly generated based on No. of bits you want to process.

step5:BFSK(Enter necessary parameters)
![Test Image 4](https://github.com/mrchocha/BFSK_QPSK_Modulation_Demodulation/blob/master/snaps/pasted%20image%200%20(3).png)
Here, bits will rendomly generated based on No. of bits you want to process.
